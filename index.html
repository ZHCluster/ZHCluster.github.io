<p>
    It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2020 "Wisdom of Pearls: Zhuhai Clusters" Meeting, hosted by the
    School
    of Physics and Astronomy (SPA), Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU).
</p>

<p>
    Galaxies are recognized as the fundamental blocks building our universe. Although studies on galaxies start early,
    it looks like that we are still on the half way to the final goal. Considering the the physics of galaxies, we are
    now trying to solve the following issues:<br>
    - What's early population of galaxies looks like? <br>
    - What kind of physics processes are responsible for variable phases of galaxy evolution? <br>
    - How well do our theoretical tools (e.g. Semi-analytical Model, HOD Model, simulations) work in reproduce theose
    physical processes? <br>
    - How can we utilize (to the maximal) the information provieded by current observations to improve theory. <br>
</p>

<p>
    Galaxy Clusters become more focused targets in recent years. In spite of their special role as cradle of galaxy
    formation where many physic processes take place, galaxy clusters are very good targets due to many reasons. In
    observations, galaxies in one cluster share similar large environments thus allows us separate specific physical
    origin for unique kind of galaxies. In theory works, galaxy clusters have just right size for us to simulate the
    physic processes down to sub-kpc range while keeping an eye on the aspects of galaxies' inter action. In this
    meeting, we would like to make a review and foresight to the researches on galaxy clusters.

    In Chinese, Zhuhai(珠海) means a sea fertile of pearls. We sincerely wish our meeting bring all attendees pearls of
    wisdom. Wish have a good week in Zhuhai!
